      I am a London-based data scientist with over 4 years of experience,
      holding a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science & Analytics from Brunel
      University and a Bachelor's degree in Marketing from Richmond American
      University. My expertise spans various domains including:


      *   bioinformatics


      *   ESG analytics


      *   climate science


      *   financial markets.


      In my professional journey, I have developed advanced machine learning
      models, such as hierarchical classification for prostate cancer and ESG
      risk impact assessments, integrating sophisticated algorithms to derive
      actionable insights. My proficiency in


      *   R,


      *   Python, and


      *   MySQL,


      combined with data visualization tools like 


      *   Tableau and 


      *   Power BI, 


      empowers me to transform complex data into clear, impactful narratives.


      I have worked as an Associate Consultant at Montash, recruiting top talent
      for specialized IT roles, and as a Banking Associate at Virgin Money,
      where I developed dashboards to enhance employee efficiency and led data
      management training sessions. My roles in business development and data
      analysis at organizations like Reeves Independent and the Bank of England
      have further refined my skills in data workflows, quality assurance, and
      stakeholder collaboration.


      My passions include bioinformatics, ESG analytics, climate science, and
      financial market analysis. I am fluent in Spanish and possess strong
      communication and leadership skills, demonstrated through various
      leadership positions and the development of innovative projects like the
      Insight iOS app.


      **I am dedicated to using technology to tackle real-world problems and
      drive sustainable impact. With a strong commitment to continuous learning
      and innovation, I strive to contribute to projects that harness data to
      improve decision-making and create meaningful change.**
