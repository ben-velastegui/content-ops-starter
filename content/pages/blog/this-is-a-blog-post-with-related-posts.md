Prostate Cancer Biomarker Discovery Using Genetic Algorithms and Machine Learning

Project Overview: This project replicates and enhances the study "A Hierarchical Machine Learning Model to Discover Gleason Grade-Specific Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer" by Hamzeh et al., 2019. The original study utilized Naïve Bayes and SVM classifiers for identifying potential genetic biomarkers linked to Gleason scores. My approach introduces genetic algorithms for feature selection to improve the model's predictive power and robustness.

Objectives:

*   Replicate Hamzeh et al.'s classification system with genetic algorithms.

*   Develop a novel classification system as an R package.

*   Validate the new model using the same dataset (GEO accession: GSE54460) and an additional dataset.

*   Compare the performance of genetic algorithms with traditional feature selection methods.

Methodology:

*   Data Preprocessing: Handle high-dimensional genomic data and prepare it for analysis.

*   Feature Selection: Use genetic algorithms to optimize the selection of gene subsets, enhancing model performance.

*   Model Implementation: Integrate genetic algorithms with hierarchical machine learning models (Naïve Bayes and SVM).

*   Validation and Testing: Rigorously test the model on multiple datasets to ensure accuracy and robustness.

Results:

*   Development of an R package that includes functions for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and prediction.

*   Comparative analysis showing the effectiveness of genetic algorithms in improving model performance.

Technologies Used:

*   R Programming: For data analysis, model development, and package creation.

*   Genetic Algorithms: For optimizing feature selection in high-dimensional datasets.

*   Machine Learning Models: Naïve Bayes and SVM for classification tasks.

Outcome: The project aims to provide a robust tool for prostate cancer biomarker discovery, potentially leading to improved diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. The final R package will be user-friendly, rigorously tested, and well-documented to facilitate its adoption by researchers.
