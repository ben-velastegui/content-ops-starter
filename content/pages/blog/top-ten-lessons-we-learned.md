Project Description

The SFCMS addresses the critical issue of greenwashing in the financial sector, leveraging advanced data science techniques to ensure transparency in sustainability reporting and combat misleading environmental claims.

#### Key Presentation Highlights

During the conference, I had the honor to present alongside distinguished delegates such as:

*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Scrutinizing textual data for misleading sustainability claims.

*   **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Monitoring ESG metrics and financial transactions for irregularities.

#### Award Recognition

The SFCMS was honored with an award at the DiFoR conference, recognizing its innovative approach and potential impact on sustainable finance regulation. This accolade underscores our commitment to advancing transparent and sustainable financial practices.
